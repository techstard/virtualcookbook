_Here is a skeleton description on the report._

link?

Things to think about when writing:

  * Never write *"our"* and *"we"* when writing. Think of yourself as a neutral part trying to explain the project.
  * If you find words that sounds hard to understand, enter them in the *wordlist*.
  * You have to give *references* on everything you write, like the fasttag parser. Look below on how to give proper references.
  * Write your chapter/s and *send them to Anders* so that he can manage them into the actual report.

Until the first deadline, chapter 1 and 2 should be written and done.

*DEADLINE 1:* Sunday the 1st of June

Until the second deadline, chapter 3 and the appendix should be written and done.
