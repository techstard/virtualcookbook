Things to think about when writing:

  * Never write *"our"* and *"we"* when writing. Think of yourself as a neutral part trying to explain the project.
  * If you find words that sounds hard to understand, enter them in the *wordlist*.
  * You have to give references on everything you write, like the fasttag parser. Look below on how to give proper references.
  * Write your chapter/s and send them to Anders so that he can manage them into the actual report.
