Today we met with Fredrik and discussed the project. We got some things clearer and it now feels as if we are more on track and know what we should do next.

After the meeting with Fredrik we sat down and made a simple bit of code so that we now can identify simple sentence structures such as verbs, nouns, objects and subjects.

Today I started analyzing the parser (FastTag.java and Tokenizer.java) in an attempt to get an understanding of it and to document it for later use in the report. When done I will hopefully have a quite explanatory Graph (UML) for how the parser works.

Have been working with the logic. Have fixed so that the logic will convert all plural strings to singular so that we can add them to the kb (knowledge base) and later do querys towards the database.
