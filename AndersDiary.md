I added some more recipes for the database. Me and Tobias wrote a class in java that connects to my local recipedatabase. It was a little hard but we got the connection in the end. I met Tobias later in the week and we exported my database to Tobias server that he has at home. Now everybody can connect to the database, and also configure it from their computers. We wrote a simple query that could search the database and it worked fine. The goal is to write a general query with a lot of variables that could either be empty or filled with several requisites that Gusteau get's from the user. We have a little work left to do, but I believe it will be done about next week. I didn't do the test exam on the course homepage this week, but i'll try to do it next week. The rest of the group managed to implement first order logic with the parser so that parts of sentences could be understood as negated or not. The parser can now interpret more advanced sentences than before.

## Course Week 3 ##
_14/4 - 20/4_

This week the database was finished! There was only a few relationship connections that needed some patching. Now you can search the database for recipes, including IDs, names, descriptions, plans on how to cook them, and also their ingredients, with the right amount and measure of each. You can also search for different categories of ingredients, like meat or vegetables. And you can also search for different types of dishes, like desserts, appetizers or drinks. Some ingredients have warninglabels on them like vegeterian or lactoseintolerance. The other members of the group have now added different features to the java applet. There is now a splash screen with Gusteau's face on it. More importantly, a better and simpler version of a parser has been found. Robert and Spanky managed to implement it to the program.

## Course Week 2 ##
_7/4 - 13/4_

This week the group decided that our intelligent agent should be a french chef. We had Gusteau in mind from Pixar's hit movie Ratatouille. A basic java applet was made with a textfield and an input field. No feedback is yet given, only a "I can't understand you" type of message. Me and Tobias made some progress creating the database, but it isn't finished yet. I found a complete parser on the internet. A link parser, that can interpret sentences and catergorize the words as nouns, verbs or the like. It's name i The Link Grammar Praser, and is written by Davy Temperly, Daniel Sleator and John Lafferty. Perhaps it's to advanced for our needs, but we will look it up.

## Course Week 1 ##
_31/3 - 6/4_

We met at friday on the first lecture, there we formed our group. We are now group 22 in the Artificial Intelligence course. We had a meeting afterwards where we decided which type of project we should choose and
also who should be working on what throughout the project. Me and Tobias got the database part because we both did the course TDA357, databases before we had more knowledge in SQL which could help us with search and quering data in the project. We began workding right away with designing the database. We made it as far as having testing the different tables and relations on a local server. It worked well. If we can design it just right it will save us a lot of time in the future when we send it queries. The more sorting and searching the database does, the less we need to search and sort the data in the JAVA code later, which will save us time.
